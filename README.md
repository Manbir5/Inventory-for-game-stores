# Game Inventory

This is a full stack application that represents the inventory of a game franchise.

A database is used to store all of the users, games, consoles, stores and their corresponding information.

There is also a frontend or user interface where an user can add, subtract items or create relationships between
items. 

The connection information for the database was removed for security reasons. However, an user can enter their own
database information in dbcon.js to get this working again. 

Thank you,
